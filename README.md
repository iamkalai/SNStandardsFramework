**SNStandardsFramework**
====================

This is a global app that can be used on ServiceNow to create a best practice/development standards framework

**Description:**
----------------

Ensuring good developments practices are followed is a challenge on ServiceNow space since the application does not provide any native support or adds any constraints in the system, that can stop/alert the developers from following bad practices. This becomes even more challenging if multiple vendors are involved in instance maintenance or development or if the team has members of varying experiences.

Over time, this results in increased maintenance cost of the system and inflated upgrade costs and efforts.

This application/framework is an attempt to reduce such risks and can be used by developers or implementer of the application to introduce constraints, development standards, naming standards, etc without much of an effort.


**Installation:**
-------------

*Install the updatesets found in dist folder* - SNStandardsFramework-V1.0 updateset creates the application and all the needed components in the instance. All the components that are being created are new and do not change any out of the box settings.

After installing the first updateset, install SNStandardsFramework-V1.1 as it contains bug fixes to allow execution of multiple scripts defined on the same script.

You can optionally, install the SNStandardsFramework-Test-Data updateset as well, to get some test constraints added to the system and you can use that for reference.

**Usage:**
----------

**Note:** ***This is meant to be only used for development environment*** and do not install it on Production as the framework is still in development stage and some of the things built as part of this might show up on ACE report.

Once you have installed the application, you can access from the left navigation as 'SN Standards' application. Use the 'All' module to view all test data if you have also used the test-data update set. 

Since the framework basically uses 2 global scripts to run the entire thing, I have added some constraints that will make sure that those doesn't run for all the tables. The flipside of this would be, you will need to update the property *SN_Standards_Validator_Tables* that gets installed with the updateset and add table names manually if you are adding constraints for a newer table.

**u_sn_standards** table acts  data table and we can define any script that needs to be run against a ServiceNow table. The script defined in this table is either run during onload of the form or onsubmit of the form. We can also add keyword based and pattern based search that can be run against the script field of the script objects.

**Current Design Restrictions:**

 - If you are adding script based checks, the scripts should be self
   invoking anonymous Javascript function by design and it will not work if we write anything otherwise.
 - The on-load type of script does not expect return statement.
 - On-submit type of script needs to return true or false explicitly else the check will fail. This is to ensure that on-submit scripts are executed per order defined and first function returning false will stop subsequent scripts from executing.
 - Pattern based search does not return the line number details of the search where keyword search will provide the line number details if the match is found in the script.
